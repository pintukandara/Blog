  <h3>What I Do</h3>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate full-stack developer with experience in Python, HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, and SQL. I enjoy building web applications from the ground up,
    turning ideas into functional and visually appealing solutions. Whether itâ€™s
    backend logic or frontend design, I like solving real-world problems through
    clean code and thoughtful design. I'm currently learning React.js and soon
    diving into Django to build powerful full-stack projects. I also like
    sharing my journey, challenges, and projects through this blog to help and
    connect with fellow developers.
